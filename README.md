# K-nearest neighbors Project Tutorial
> 4 Geeks Academy - project by @karenL26 :elf:

In this guided project we will learn how to build a simple movie recommender system using k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
The aim is to answer if can we predict which films will be highly rated, even if they are not a commercial success?

You can find some basic exploratory and the data preparation [here](src/explore_knn.ipynb).

The pipeline construction is [here](src/app.py).

The datasets were obtained from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/k-nearest-neighbors-project-tutorial/main/tmdb_5000_movies.csv) and this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/k-nearest-neighbors-project-tutorial/main/tmdb_5000_credits.csv).
